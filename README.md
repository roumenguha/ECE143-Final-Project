# ECE143-Final-Project
 Final project repo for Group 12 ECE 143 Fall 2020
 
 You can read our proposal in Group 12 Proposal.pdf, and view our final presentation in Group 12 Final Presentation.pdf
 
 We use Seaborn, Holoviews, and Scikit-Learn. All other packages are included in a typical Anaconda distribution.

 Main notebook is available inside FinalProject.ipynb. Please check this to see our main figures. Alternatively, check the Visualizations folder for some examples of the figures we generated, before we decided which ones to include in our final presentation.
 
 dataloader.py merges the two datasets we use for this project.
 
 regress.py contains our code for polynomial fitting; it outputs data for the fit-polynomials of specified-degree.
 
 data_analysis.py plots the merged data in a very naive way; these are meant to serve as introductions to the dataset.
 
 data_exploration.py is where the majority of our analysis took place. Here we compare specific traits vs specific resources, and perform our case study of Bhutan.
